== _Management Summary_

=== About
*EuregJUG Maas-Rhine* is a cross-border, english-language Java User Group. Java User Groups (JUGs) are volunteer, non-commercial organizations of enthusiasts that strive to distribute Java-related knowledge in their neighbourhood. They provide a meeting place for Java users to get information, share resources and solutions, increase networking and expand Java Technology expertise. The Euregio Maas-Rhine is lacking such a group, despite its potential of nearly 4m inhabitants and an infrastructure of computer science related universities and companies. We want to fill that gap.

„EuregJUG“ is a portmanteau of „Euregio“ and „JUG“ (Java User Group) emphasizing the geographical (Aachen - Maastricht - Liège area) and technical (everything JVM) scope of the group.

=== Aim
*EuregJUG Maas-Rhine* strives to offer high-quality bimonthly talks about Java related topics from local and invited speakers, free to anyone interested.

- Content of the talks: Everything related to Java or JVM-based languages from academia to business applications, software development tools or methodologies
- Frequency: A single talk of 60-90 minutes roughly every two months + discussion
- When: On a weekday, starting 18:00 - 19:00 local, so that people can participate after their day jobs
- Language: English, according to the cross-border scope and to attract foreign students & employees
- Costs: Free and open to anyone interested
- Intended audience: Students, employees of software companies, interested hobbyists
- Expected regular number of visitors: 25-50, hopefully increasing over time
- Incentives: raffle of technical (programming) books for listeners before the talk (thanks to O'Reilly Media), free drinks (thanks to ENERKO Informatik GmbH)
- Get-together for interested visitors with the speaker after the talk, accompanied by free drinks

=== Location
A suitable room is provided by http://www.bitstars.de[bitstars], a RWTH Aachen-born startup innovating in the field of virtual and augmented reality. The room is located in the vicinity of the Aachen city center, near the „Aachen Schanz“ railway station. It is easily accessible by car, bus or train.

=== First talks
- May 28th, 2015: „Building Modular Java Applications in the Cloud Age“ (Bert Ertman — 30 participants)
- August 25th, 2015: „Free Open Source Tools for Maven, HTML5, IoT, and Java EE“ (Geertjan Wielenga)

=== We need Support
- Sponsoring to cover expenses to invite high-profile speakers (travel costs)
- Sponsors may display their logo (roll-up-display, posters) and are invited to provide paper flyers for job offers if interested
- Sponsors will be credited before the talks and on the web site www.euregjug.eu 
- Instead of financial sponsorship, interested companies may offer their thematically fitting speaker „for free“ (sponsoring travel and working time to give the talk)
